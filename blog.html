            <h4>Madi Smith</h4>
            <p>
                Hello I am Madi! I learned about FemFit from an advertisement on Instagram. I bought their workout clothes and learned of all the additional resources they have available. I struggle with extreme anxiety and workouts have always been my escape to help control it. I started using the at home workouts FemFit provides and I fell in love instantly. They provide great resources to help me learn more about my anxiety and how staying active can improve my wellbeing.

            <h4>Clara Anderson</h4>
            <p>
                Hello I am Clara! I learned about FemFit from a friend who started doing their at home workouts. I never used to workout and I rarely even did any physical activity. I struggle with depression and was diagnosed at a young age. I started out very slowly with FemFit's workout guides and resources; now I don't think I would be where I am today if I didn't take a chance on the company. I hope my story can be an inspiration to help more people who have struggled like I have.
