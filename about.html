        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            FemFit is a female owned business located in Minneapolis, MN, that makes workout clothing from recycled materials and strives to empower women throughout the company. The company was founded by Gabby Renk in the spring of 2022 because she wanted women to feel comfortable while working out and learned that staying active is an important part of helping out your mental health. Gabby knows mental health is an important part of life, and FemFit works to incorporate help and awareness through their brand; being active is a great way to destress and focus on yourself. FemFit is an online business that hopes one day to open a gym and resource center for women. FemFit has a line of sustainable clothing that women can wear for working out or lounging around. The company also has free online at home workouts and resources for those struggling with mental health.
