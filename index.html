            FemFit is a female owned business located in Minneapolis, MN, that makes workout clothing from recycled materials and strives to empower women throughout the company. Our goal is to promote mental health, feminism and healthy lifestyle through our website and clothing. We want women to feel empowered and encouraged to reach their goals in life. Mental health is an important part of life, and FemFit works to incorporate help and awareness through our brand; being active is a great way to destress and focus on yourself.
